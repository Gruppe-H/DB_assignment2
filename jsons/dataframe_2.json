To construct this regional inventory, the INEMAR software was used (INventario EMissioni ARia: Air Emissions Inventory), which consists of an application system created to estimate the emissions of various pollutants, for various types of activity (e.g.: heating, traffic, agriculture and industry) and by type of fuel, according to the international classification adopted in the field of EMEP-CORINAIR inventories. As envisaged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines, in order to calculate emissions, the \u201cbottom\u2010up\u201d method was used, based on the sector end-use of fuels. In those cases where it was not possible to obtain accurate data, particularly concerning territorial data, a \"top-down\" approach was used, resorting to statistical processing of data aggregated at a provincial level.\nThe overall picture of emissions of the Terre Estensi Association was built from the emissions inventory of the individual Municipalities of Ferrara, Masi Torello and Voghiera that constitute the Association, making the sum of the contributions of the three Municipalities.

There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w\/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEI\u2019s protocol and guidance.","Current Population Year":2014,"City Population":27450.0,"City GDP":23000000.0,"GDP Currency":"USD     US Dollar","Year of GDP":2014.0,"GDP Source":"Solano EDC http:\/\/www.solanocounty.com\/depts\/bos\/working_to_create_jobs\/economic_studies.asp","Average annual temperature (in Celsius)\u200b":21.0,"\u200bLand area (in square km)":13.0,"Average altitude (m)":26.0,"City Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[38.049365,-122.1585777]},"Country Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.09024,-95.712891]}},{"Account Number":35862,"City Name":"City of Detroit","Country":"USA","City":"Detroit","C40 City":false,"Reporting Year":2016,"Measurement Year":"12\/31\/2012 12:00:00 AM","Boundary":"Administrative boundary of a local government","Primary Methodology":"U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ICLEI)","Methodology Details":null,"Gases included":"CO2; CH4; N2O","Total emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":10329322.0,"Total Scope 1 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":null,"Total Scope 2 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":4809082.0,"Increase\/Decrease from last year":"Stayed the same","Reason for increase\/decrease in emissions":"This is the only inventory we have done.

Several exogenous factors reduced emissions - such as lower electricity emission factors due to a cleaner electric grid, and better fuel efficiency and lower tailpipe emission factors for cleaner vehicles. However, Pittsburgh did see reductions in the tonnage of solid waste sent to landfill and a reduction in vehicle miles traveled. The industrial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2003, and less natural gas in 2013 than in 2008. The commercial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2008, but used significantly more natural gas. The residential sector increased electricity use and substantially increased natural gas use. The increase in natural gas is likely due to improved data quality, but seems to also correlate to the rise of hydraulic fracturing in the region.
