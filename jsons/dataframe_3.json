The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts.Compiling Baltimore City\u2019s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records.For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City\u2019s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City\u2019s inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs.","Gases included":"CO2; CH4; N2O","Total emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":7230859.0,"Scopes Included ":"Total Scope 1 and Scope 2","Total Scope 1 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":12032078.0,"Total Scope 2 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":3211447.0,"Comment":"medium\/high.

This occurred despite an emissions increase in the Railways sub-sector emissions which was affected by a methodology change in the way Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) began collecting more specific power data and their use of a more conservative or higher emissions factor starting CY2013.\n\nRegarding the Waste sector, first, wastewater fugitive data collection was improved with better activity data.  This resulted in a more accurate picture of the contribution of fugitive wastewater emissions; thus, cutting by nearly half what was originally reporting in 2012. Consequently, when we compare the Waste sector since last inventoried,  emissions actually increased 18% influenced by not only an increase in total wastewater treatment and discharge emissions, but also because of an 18% increase in solid waste disposed emissions.  The updated CY2013 waste characterization study was more detailed which allowed a closer look at organic waste.

This information is further adjusted by provincial fleet data and mileage statistics available for vehicle type. The natural gas consumption in vehicles is received directly from the natural gas distributor. The conversion factors are derived from various sources: electricity grid intensity comes from Statistics Canada - this factor, is always two years behind the calendar year; natural gas and liquid fuel combustion factors are from US Environmental protection Agency, and Natural Resources Canada references, and the local utilities.

A high unemployment rate means that less workers are commuting, and perhaps trips for leisure have also been curtailed.","City Population":1235055,"Population year":2016,"GDP":113400000000.0,"GDP Currency":"CAD     Canadian Dollar","GDP Year":2016.0,"GDP Source":"http:\/\/www.calgaryeconomicdevelopment.com\/dmsdocument\/22","Average annual temperature (in Celsius)\u200b":4.1,"\u200bAverage altitude (m)":1084.0,"\u200bLand area (in square km)":848.0,"City Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[51.048615,-114.070846]},"Country Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[56.130366,-106.346771]}},{"Organisation Number":31111,"Organisation":"Tokyo Metropolitan Government","City":"Tokyo","Country":"Japan","Region":"East Asia","C40 City":true,"Access":"Public","Reporting Year":2017,"Accounting year":"2013-04-01 - 2014-03-31","Boundary":"Administrative boundary of a local government","Protocol":"Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI)","Protocol column":null,"Gases included":null,"Total emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":70733403.0,"Scopes Included ":"Total Scope 1, Scope 2 and Waste Scope 3 (Total BASIC emissions)","Total Scope 1 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":33363185.0,"Total Scope 2 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":43602201.0,"Comment":null,"Increase\/Decrease from last year":"This is our first year of calculation","Reason for increase\/decrease in emissions":null,"City Population":13646764,"Population year":2017,"GDP":94400000000000.0,"GDP Currency":"JPY     Japanese yen","GDP Year":2016.0,"GDP Source":null,"Average annual temperature (in Celsius)\u200b":null,"\u200bAverage altitude (m)":null,"\u200bLand area (in square km)":2191.0,"City Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.6896342,139.6921007]},"Country Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.204824,138.252924]}},{"Organisation Number":54113,"Organisation":"City of Flagstaff","City":"Flagstaff","Country":"USA","Region":"North America","C40 City":false,"Access":"Public","Reporting Year":2017,"Accounting year":"2016-01-01 - 2016-12-31","Boundary":"Administrative boundary of a local government","Protocol":"Other: Excel","Protocol column":"Formulas taken from The Climate Registry: Pacificorp Data ('07 Generation)","Gases included":"CO2","Total emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":1424563.0,"Scopes Included ":"Total Scope 1 and Scope 2","Total Scope 1 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":949707.2,"Total Scope 2 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":474855.76,"Comment":"Our emissions inventory is based on the best data available.

There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w\/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEI\u2019s protocol and guidance.","City Population":27450,"Population year":2014,"GDP":23000000.0,"GDP Currency":"USD     US Dollar","GDP Year":2014.0,"GDP Source":"Solano EDC http:\/\/www.solanocounty.com\/depts\/bos\/working_to_create_jobs\/economic_studies.asp","Average annual temperature (in Celsius)\u200b":21.0,"\u200bAverage altitude (m)":26.0,"\u200bLand area (in square km)":13.0,"City Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[38.049365,-122.1585777]},"Country Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.09024,-95.712891]}},{"Organisation Number":54070,"Organisation":"City of Eugene","City":"Eugene","Country":"USA","Region":"North America","C40 City":false,"Access":"Public","Reporting Year":2017,"Accounting year":"2015-01-01 - 2015-12-31","Boundary":"Administrative boundary of a local government","Protocol":"Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI)","Protocol column":"This inventory also considers guidance provided by Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s Scope 2 Guidance and ICLEI's U.S. Community Protocol.","Gases included":null,"Total emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":null,"Scopes Included ":"Total Scope 1, Scope 2 and Waste Scope 3 (Total BASIC emissions)","Total Scope 1 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":812688.0,"Total Scope 2 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":955102.0,"Comment":null,"Increase\/Decrease from last year":"Increased","Reason for increase\/decrease in emissions":"The primary reason for the increase compared to 2005 reporting is a change in accounting methodology for electricity in the Eugene Community Inventory.

Since 2010 transportation emissions have decreased by -7% and natural gas emissions have gone down by --7% in the residential sector and -1% in the commercial \/ industrial sectors.","City Population":165885,"Population year":2016,"GDP":14322000000.0,"GDP Currency":"USD     US Dollar","GDP Year":2015.0,"GDP Source":"U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Regional Data, Eugene, OR (Metropolitan Statistical Area), All Industry Total","Average annual temperature (in Celsius)\u200b":11.2,"\u200bAverage altitude (m)":130.0,"\u200bLand area (in square km)":113.0,"City Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[44.0519,-123.0867]},"Country Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.09024,-95.712891]}},{"Organisation Number":58357,"Organisation":"City of West Hollywood","City":"West Hollywood","Country":"USA","Region":"North America","C40 City":false,"Access":"Public","Reporting Year":2017,"Accounting year":"2008-01-01 - 2008-12-31","Boundary":"Administrative boundary of a local government","Protocol":"U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ICLEI)","Protocol column":null,"Gases included":"CO2","Total emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":583213.0,"Scopes Included ":"Total Scope 1 and Scope 2","Total Scope 1 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":null,"Total Scope 2 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)":null,"Comment":null,"Increase\/Decrease from last year":"Stayed the same","Reason for increase\/decrease in emissions":"We have not conducted a GHG inventory since 2008 but the City received a Strategic Growth Council grant to create a GHG inventory tool this year 2017.

As in 2013, the scope 1 emissions are dominated by transport emissions, which have remained fairly constant across the period, demonstrating a 5kt increase. This change is largely due to increases in estimates in private marine fuel consumption after the use of more detailed, disaggregated fuel import data, as described in Section 4.2.1 of the inventory report. IPPU emissions remain a significant source of scope 1 emissions, and have also increased by 1kt in comparison to 2013. Emissions in this sector are estimated using population as a proxy, and therefore population growth within Gibraltar will have somewhat influenced the calculated increase in scope 1 emissions. Improved data has also been used to calculate IPPU emissions in Gibraltar; for example, activity data regarding MDIs and N2O use has been provided by the Gibraltar Health Authority, rather than relying on scaling UK data. \nWhen scope 2 emissions are considered, there is a 30kt decline in total emissions. A reduction in consumed gas oil used for electricity generation and an apparent improvement of the implied emission factor cause a decline in emissions from residential, and commercial, industrial, and government buildings and facilities. This is largely responsible for this trend.\nWaterborne navigation emissions have declined due to a methodology change within the calculation of emissions from shipping. As outlined in Section 4.2.3 of the inventory report, the definition of shipping attributable to Gibraltar on the basis of the recorded \u2018purpose of call\u2019 has undergone significant changes, and as a result, the emissions from scope 3 are largely reduced in 2015. \nBecause of a large number of method changes, an updated reporting approach using the now-finalised GPC, and data for the 2015 inventory method not being available for updating the 2013 inventory, it is not possible to confidently identify how much change in emissions is due to changing method versus changing activity.

During that time, Chicago\u2019s population grew by approximately 1 percent while the region\u2019s GRP grew by more than 12 percent.

When considering percent reductions, the waste sector experienced the greatest reduction (30 percent) which included a 35 percent emissions reduction in the solid waste disposal sub-sector. This reduction in the solid waste sector is likely driven by a decrease in the total amount of solid waste sent to landfills and an improvement in the solid waste treatment technologies at those landfills. The City expanded its residential curbside recycling pilot program to now serve over 400,000, or approximately 33 percent, of additional City houeholds.Because of the program\u2019s expansion the City experienced a significant increase in the number of tons collected for recycling, from 58,000 in 2010 to 97,000 in 2015.\n\nThe stationary energy sector overall saw a 10 percent drop in emissions, including 11, 12 and 8 percent emissions reductions in the residential, commercial and institutional buildings and facilities, and manufacturing industries and construction sub-sectors, respectively. Stationary energy sector GHG emissions reductions are likely driven by a general trend in the building industry to improve energy efficiency of buildings as well as a regional shift in energy generation towards renewable energy sources.

The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data).

Palo Alto Landfill Fugitive Emissions and Wastewater Process Emissions decreased due to efficiency measures.","City Population":66478,"Population year":2017,"GDP":null,"GDP Currency":"USD     US Dollar","GDP Year":null,"GDP Source":"City GDP data is not available","Average annual temperature (in Celsius)\u200b":15.0,"\u200bAverage altitude (m)":7.0,"\u200bLand area (in square km)":67.0,"City Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.4419,-122.143]},"Country Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.09024,-95.712891]}},{"Organisation Number":35859,"Organisation":"City of Cleveland","City":"Cleveland","Country":"USA","Region":"North America","C40 City":false,"Access":"Public","Reporting Year":2017,"Accounting year":"2015-01-01 - 2015-12-31","Boundary":"Administrative boundary of a local government","Protocol":"Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI)","Protocol column":"This inventory was assembled through the collection and analysis of data with City of Cleveland staff as well as other city stakeholders such as utilities, regional coordinating agencies, local organizations and large emitters.The inventory was updated using the Global Protocol for Community Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI).
